CLASS net/minecraft/class_4491 com/mojang/blaze3d/systems/RenderCallStorage
	COMMENT A storage of render calls with recording and processing states. It exposes
	COMMENT three queues: a recording queue, a processing queue, and a last processed
	COMMENT queue. The recording queue is equal to the processing queue during processing
	COMMENT and different during recording.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This storage appears to be a work in progress, as its processing currently
	COMMENT performs no operation.
